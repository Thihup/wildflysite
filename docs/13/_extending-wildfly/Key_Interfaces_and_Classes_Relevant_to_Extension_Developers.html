<p>In the first major section of this guide, we provided an example of how
to implement an extension to the AS. The emphasis there was learning by
doing. In this section, we&#8217;ll focus a bit more on the major WildFly
interfaces and classes that most are relevant to extension developers.
The best way to learn about these interfaces and classes in detail is to
look at their javadoc. What we&#8217;ll try to do here is provide a brief
introduction of the key items and how they relate to each other.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before digging into this section, readers are encouraged to read the
"Core Management Concepts" section of the Admin Guide.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="extension-interface">Extension Interface</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>org.jboss.as.controller.Extension</code> interface is the hook by which
your extension to the AS kernel is able to integrate with the AS. During
boot of the AS, when the <code>&lt;extension&gt;</code> element in the AS&#8217;s xml
configuration file naming your extension is parsed, the JBoss Modules
module named in the element&#8217;s name attribute is loaded. The standard JDK
<code>java.lang.ServiceLoader</code> mechanism is then used to load your module&#8217;s
implementation of this interface.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The function of an <code>Extension</code> implementation is to register with the
core AS the management API, xml parsers and xml marshallers associated
with the extension module&#8217;s subsystems. An <code>Extension</code> can register
multiple subsystems, although the usual practice is to register just one
per extension.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the <code>Extension</code> is loaded, the core AS will make two invocations
upon it:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>void initializeParsers(ExtensionParsingContext context)</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When this is invoked, it is the <code>Extension</code> implementation&#8217;s
responsibility to initialize the XML parsers for this extension&#8217;s
subsystems and register them with the given <code>ExtensionParsingContext</code>.
The parser&#8217;s job when it is later called is to create
<code>org.jboss.dmr.ModelNode</code> objects representing WildFly management API
operations needed make the AS&#8217;s running configuration match what is
described in the xml. Those management operation <code>ModelNode</code> s are added
to a list passed in to the parser.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A parser for each version of the xml schema used by a subsystem should
be registered. A well behaved subsystem should be able to parse any
version of its schema that it has ever published in a final release.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>void initialize(ExtensionContext context)</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When this is invoked, it is the <code>Extension</code> implementation&#8217;s
responsibility to register with the core AS the management API for its
subsystems, and to register the object that is capable of marshalling
the subsystem&#8217;s in-memory configuration back to XML. Only one XML
marshaller is registered per subsystem, even though multiple XML parsers
can be registered. The subsystem should always write documents that
conform to the latest version of its XML schema.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The registration of a subsystem&#8217;s management API is done via the
<code>ManagementResourceRegistration</code> interface. Before discussing that
interface in detail, let&#8217;s describe how it (and the related <code>Resource</code>
interface) relate to the notion of managed resources in the AS.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="wildfly-managed-resources">WildFly Managed Resources</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each subsystem is responsible for managing one or more management
resources. The conceptual characteristics of a management resource are
covered in some detail in the <a href="Admin_Guide.html#Management_resources">Admin
Guide</a>; here we&#8217;ll just summarize the main points. A management resource
has</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>An <strong><em>address</em></strong> consisting of a list of key/value pairs that uniquely
identifies a resource</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zero or more <strong><em>attributes</em></strong> , the value of which is some sort of
<code>org.jboss.dmr.ModelNode</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zero or more supported <strong><em>operations</em></strong> . An operation has a string name
and zero or more parameters, each of which is a key/value pair where the
key is a string naming the parameter and the value is some sort of
<code>ModelNode</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zero or more <strong><em>children</em></strong> , each of which in turn is a managed
resource</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The implementation of a managed resource is somewhat analogous to the
implementation of a Java object. A managed resource will have a "type",
which encapsulates API information about that resource and logic used to
implement that API. And then there are actual instances of the resource,
which primarily store data representing the current state of a
particular resource. This is somewhat analogous to the "class" and
"object" notions in Java.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A managed resource&#8217;s type is encapsulated by the
<code>org.jboss.as.controller.registry.ManagementResourceRegistration</code> the
core AS creates when the type is registered. The data for a particular
instance is encapsulated in an implementation of the
<code>org.jboss.as.controller.registry.Resource</code> interface.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="managementresourceregistration-interface">ManagementResourceRegistration Interface</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the Java analogy used above, the <code>ManagementResourceRegistration</code> is
analogous to the "class", while the <code>Resource</code> discussed below is
analogous to an instance of that class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <code>ManagementResourceRegistration</code> represents the specification for a
particular managed resource type. All resources whose address matches
the same pattern will be of the same type, specified by the type&#8217;s
<code>ManagementResourceRegistration</code>. The MRR encapsulates:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <code>PathAddress</code> showing the address pattern that matches resources of
that type. This <code>PathAddress</code> can and typically does involve wildcards
in the value of one or more elements of the address. In this case there
can be more than one instance of the type, i.e. different <code>Resource</code>
instances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Definition of the various attributes exposed by resources of this
type, including the <code>OperationStepHandler</code> implementations used for
reading and writing the attribute values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Definition of the various operations exposed by resources of this
type, including the <code>OperationStepHandler</code> implementations used for
handling user invocations of those operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Definition of child resource types. <code>ManagementResourceRegistration</code>
instances form a tree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Definition of management notifications emitted by resources of this
type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Definition of
<a href="#Working_with_WildFly_Capabilities">capabilities</a> provided by
resources of this type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Definition of <a href="Admin_Guide.html#RBAC">RBAC</a> access constraints that should be
applied by the management kernel when authorizing operations against
resources of this type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether the resource type is an alias to another resource type, and if
so information about that relationship. Aliases are primarily used to
preserve backwards compatibility of the management API when the location
of a given type of resources is moved in a newer release.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>ManagementResourceRegistration</code> interface is a subinterface of
<code>ImmutableManagementResourceRegistration</code>, which provides a read-only
view of the information encapsulated by the MRR. The MRR subinterface
adds the methods needed for registering the attributes, operations,
children, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Extension developers do not directly instantiate an MRR. Instead they
create a <code>ResourceDefinition</code> for the root resource type for each
subsystem, and register it with the <code>ExtensionContext</code> passed in to
their <code>Extension</code> implementation&#8217;s <code>initialize</code> method:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    public void initialize(ExtensionContext context) {
        SubsystemRegistration subsystem = context.registerSubsystem(SUBSYSTEM_NAME, CURRENT_VERSION);
        subsystem.registerXMLElementWriter(getOurXmlWriter());
        ResourceDefinition rd = getOurSubsystemDefinition();
        ManagementResourceRegistration mrr = subsystem.registerSubsystemModel(rd));
    }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The kernel uses the provided <code>ResourceDefinition</code> to construct a
<code>ManagementResourceRegistration</code> and then passes that MRR to the various
<code>registerXXX</code> methods implemented by the <code>ResourceDefinition</code>, giving it
the change to record the resource type&#8217;s attributes, operations and
children.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="resourcedefinition-interface">ResourceDefinition Interface</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An implementation of <code>ResourceDefinition</code> is the primary class used by
an extension developer when defining a managed resource type. It
provides basic information about the type, exposes a
<code>DescriptionProvider</code> used to generate a DMR description of the type,
and implements callbacks the kernel can invoke when building up the
<code>ManagementResourceRegistration</code> to ask for registration of definitions
of attributes, operations, children, notifications and capabilities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Almost always an extension author will create their <code>ResourceDefinition</code>
by creating a subclass of the
<code>org.jboss.as.controller.SimpleResourceDefinition</code> class or of its
<code>PersistentResourceDefinition</code> subclass. Both of these classes have
constructors that take a <code>Parameters</code> object, which is a simple builder
class to use to provide most of the key information about the resource
type. The extension-specific subclass would then take responsibility for
any additional behavior needed by overriding the <code>registerAttributes</code>,
<code>registerOperations</code>, <code>registerNotifications</code> and <code>registerChildren</code>
callbacks to do whatever is needed beyond what is provided by the
superclasses.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, to add a writable attribute:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    @Override
    public void registerAttributes(ManagementResourceRegistration resourceRegistration) {

        AttributeDefinition ad = FOO; // constant declared elsewhere
        OperationStepHandler writeHandler = new FooWriteAttributeHandler();
        resourceRegistration.registerReadWriteHandler(ad, null, writeHandler); // null read handler means use default read handling
    }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To register a custom operation:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    @Override
    public void registerOperations(ManagementResourceRegistration resourceRegistration) {

        OperationDefinition od = FooBarOperationStepHandler.getDefinition();
        OperationStepHandler osh = new FooBarOperationStepHandler();
        resourceRegistration.registerOperationHandler(od, osh);
    }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To register a child resource type:</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="resourcedescriptionresolver">ResourceDescriptionResolver</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the things a <code>ResourceDefinition</code> must be able to do is provide a
<code>DescriptionProvider</code> that provides a proper DMR description of the
resource to use as the output for the standard
<code>read-resource-description</code> management operation. Since you are almost
certainly going to be using one of the standard <code>ResourceDefinition</code>
implementations like <code>SimpleResourceDefinition</code>, the creation of this
<code>DescriptionProvider</code> is largely handled for you. The one thing that is
not handled for you is providing the localized free form text
descriptions of the various attributes, operations, operation
parameters, child types, etc used in creating the resource description.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For this you must provide an implementation of the
<code>ResourceDescriptionResolver</code> interface, typically passed to the
<code>Parameters</code> object provided to the <code>SimpleResourceDefinition</code>
constructor. This interface has various methods that are invoked when a
piece of localized text description is needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Almost certainly you&#8217;ll satisfy this requirement by providing an
instance of the <code>StandardResourceDescriptionResolver</code> class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>StandardResourceDescriptionResolver</code> uses a <code>ResourceBundle</code> to load
text from a properties file available on the classpath. The keys in the
properties file must follow patterns expected by
<code>StandardResourceDescriptionResolver</code>. See the
<code>StandardResourceDescriptionResolver</code> javadoc for further details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The biggest task here is to create the properties file and add the text
descriptions. A text description must be provided for everything. The
typical thing to do is to store this properties file in the same package
as your <code>Extension</code> implementation, in a file named
<code>LocalDescriptions.properties</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="attributedefinition-class">AttributeDefinition Class</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>AttributeDefinition</code> class is used to create the static definition
of one of a managed resource&#8217;s attributes. It&#8217;s a bit poorly named
though, because the same interface is used to define the details of
parameters to operations, and to define fields in the result of of
operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The definition includes all the static information about the
attribute/operation parameter/result field, e.g. the DMR <code>ModelType</code> of
its value, whether its presence is required, whether it supports
expressions, etc. See
<a href="Admin_Guide.html#Description_of_the_Management_Model">Description of the
Management Model</a> for a description of the metadata available. Almost
all of this comes from the <code>AttributeDefinition</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Besides basic metadata, the <code>AttributeDefinition</code> can also hold custom
logic the kernel should use when dealing with the attribute/operation
parameter/result field. For example, a <code>ParameterValidator</code> to use to
perform special validation of values (beyond basic things like DMR type
checks and defined/undefined checks), or an <code>AttributeParser</code> or
<code>AttributeMarshaller</code> to use to perform customized parsing from and
marshaling to XML.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WildFly Core&#8217;s <code>controller</code> module provides a number of subclasses of
<code>AttributeDefinition</code> used for the usual kinds of attributes. For each
there is an associated builder class which you should use to build the
<code>AttributeDefinition</code>. Most commonly used are
<code>SimpleAttributeDefinition</code>, built by the associated
<code>SimpleAttributeDefinitionBuilder</code>. This is used for attributes whose
values are analogous to java primitives, <code>String</code> or byte[]. For
collections, there are various subclasses of <code>ListAttributeDefinition</code>
and <code>MapAttributeDefinition</code>. All have a <code>Builder</code> inner class. For
complex attributes, i.e. those with a fixed set of fully defined fields,
use <code>ObjectTypeAttributeDefinition</code>. (Each field in the complex type is
itself specified by an <code>AttributeDefinition</code>.) Finally there&#8217;s
<code>ObjectListAttributeDefinition</code> and <code>ObjectMapAttributeDefinition</code> for
lists whose elements are complex types and maps whose values are complex
types respectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of creating a simple attribute definition with extra
validation of the range of allowed values:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">static final AttributeDefinition QUEUE_LENGTH = new SimpleAttributeDefinitionBuilder("queue-length", ModelType.INT)
                .setRequired(true)
                .setAllowExpression(true)
                .setValidator(new IntRangeValidator(1, Integer.MAX_VALUE))
                .setRestartAllServices() // means modification after resource add puts the server in reload-required
                .build();</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Via a bit of dark magic, the kernel knows that the <code>IntRangeValidator</code>
defined here is a reliable source of information on min and max values
for the attribute, so when creating the <code>read-resource-description</code>
output for the attribute it will use it and output <code>min</code> and <code>max</code>
metadata. For STRING attributes, <code>StringLengthValidator</code> can also be
used, and the kernel will see this and provide <code>min-length</code> and
<code>max-length</code> metadata. In both cases the kernel is checking for the
presence of a <code>MinMaxValidator</code> and if found it provides the appropriate
metadata based on the type of the attribute.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Use <code>EnumValidator</code> to restrict a STRING attribute&#8217;s values to a set of
legal values:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    static final SimpleAttributeDefinition TIME_UNIT = new SimpleAttributeDefinitionBuilder("unit", ModelType.STRING)
            .setRequired(true)
            .setAllowExpression(true)
            .setValidator(new EnumValidator&lt;TimeUnit&gt;(TimeUnit.class))
            .build();</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>EnumValidator</code> is an implementation of <code>AllowedValuesValidator</code> that
works with Java enums. You can use other implementations or write your
own to do other types of restriction to certain values.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Via a bit of dark magic similar to what is done with <code>MinMaxValidator</code>,
the kernel recognizes the presence of an <code>AllowedValuesValidator</code> and
uses it to seed the <code>allowed-values</code> metadata in
<code>read-resource-description</code> output.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="key-uses-of-attributedefinition">Key Uses of AttributeDefinition</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your <code>AttributeDefinition</code> instances will be some of the most commonly
used objects in your extension code. Following are the most typical
uses. In each of these examples assume there is a
<code>SimpleAttributeDefinition</code> stored in a constant FOO_AD that is
available to the code. Typically FOO_AD would be a constant in the
relevant <code>ResourceDefinition</code> implementation class. Assume FOO_AD
represents an INT attribute.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that for all of these cases except for "Use in Extracting Data from
the Configuration Model for Use in Runtime Services" there may be
utility code that handles this for you. For example
<code>PersistentResourceXMLParser</code> can handle the XML cases, and
<code>AbstractAddStepHandler</code> can handle the "Use in Storing Data Provided by
the User to the Configuration Model" case.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="use-in-xml-parsing">Use in XML Parsing</h4>

<p>Note that the parsing code has deliberately been abbreviated. The key
point is the <code>parseAndSetParameter</code> call. FOO_AD will validate the

message if invalid, including a reference to the current location of the
<code>reader</code>. If valid, <code>value</code> will be converted to a DMR <code>ModelNode</code> of
the appropriate type and stored as a parameter field of <code>addOp</code>. The
name of the parameter will be what <code>FOO_AD.getName()</code> returns.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the <code>ModelController</code> at the heart of the WildFly Core management
layer handles a request to execute an operation, it instantiates an
implementation of the <code>OperationContext</code> interface to do the work. The
<code>OperationContext</code> is configured with an initial list of operation steps
it must execute. This is done in one of two ways:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>During boot, multiple steps are configured, one for each operation in
the list generated by the parser of the xml configuration file. For each
operation, the <code>ModelController</code> finds the
<code>ManagementResourceRegistration</code> that matches the address of the
operation and finds the <code>OperationStepHandler</code> registered with that MRR
for the operation&#8217;s name. A step is added to the <code>OperationContext</code> for
each operation by providing the operation <code>ModelNode</code> itself, plus the
<code>OperationStepHandler</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After boot, any management request involves only a single operation,
so only a single step is added. (Note that a <code>composite</code> operation is
still a single operation; it&#8217;s just one that internally executes via
multiple steps.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>ModelController</code> then asks the <code>OperationContext</code> to execute the
operation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>OperationContext</code> acts as both the engine for operation execution,
and as the interface provided to <code>OperationStepHandler</code> implementations
to let them interact with the rest of the system.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="execution-process">Execution Process</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Operation execution proceeds via execution by the <code>OperationContext</code> of
a series of "steps" with an <code>OperationStepHandler</code> doing the key work
for each step. As mentioned above, during boot the OC is initially
configured with a number of steps, but post boot operations involve only
a single step initially. But even a post-boot operation can end up
involving numerous steps before completion. In the case of a
<code>/:read-resource(recursive=true)</code> operation, thousands of steps might
execute. This is possible because one of the key things an
<code>OperationStepHandler</code> can do is ask the <code>OperationContext</code> to add
additional steps to execute later.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Execution proceeds via a series of "stages", with a queue of steps
maintained for each stage. An <code>OperationStepHandler</code> can tell the
<code>OperationContext</code> to add a step for any stage equal to or later than
the currently executing stage. The instruction can either be to add the
step to the head of the queue for the stage or to place it at the end of
the stage&#8217;s queue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Execution of a stage continues until there are no longer any steps in
the stage&#8217;s queue. Then an internal transition task can execute, and the

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If any step fails during this stage, the operation will automatically
roll back. Rollback of MODEL stage failures cannot be turned off.
Rollback during boot results in abort of the process start.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The initial step or steps added to the <code>OperationContext</code> by the
<code>ModelController</code> all execute in Stage.MODEL. This means that all
<code>OperationStepHandler</code> instances your extension registers with a
<code>ManagementResourceRegistration</code> must be designed for execution in
<code>Stage.MODEL</code>. If you need work done in later stages your <code>Stage.MODEL</code>
handler must add a step for that work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When this stage completes, the <code>OperationContext</code> internally performs
model validation work before proceeding on to the next stage. Validation
failures will result in rollback.</p>

<h4 id="stage.runtime">Stage.RUNTIME</h4>

<p>This stage is concerned with interacting with the server runtime, either
reading from it or modifying it (e.g. installing or removing services or
updating their configuration.) By the time this stage begins, all model
changes are complete and model validity has been checked. So typically
handlers in this stage read their inputs from the model, not from the
original <code>operation</code> <code>ModelNode</code> provided by the user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most <code>OperationStepHandler</code> logic written by extension authors will be
for Stage.RUNTIME. The vast majority of Stage.MODEL handling can best be
performed by the base handler classes WildFly Core provides in its

by a handler will trigger rollback.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the end of <code>Stage.RUNTIME</code>, the <code>OperationContext</code> blocks waiting for

<p>Service container verification work is performed in this stage, checking
that any MSC changes made in <code>Stage.RUNTIME</code> had the expected effect.
Typically extension authors do not add any steps in this stage, as the
steps automatically added by the <code>OperationContext</code> itself are all that
are needed. You can add a step here though if you have an unusual use
case where you need to verify something after MSC has stabilized.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Handlers in this stage should not make any further runtime changes;
their purpose is simply to do verification work and fail the operation
if verification is unsuccessful.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>While no <code>OperationStepHandler</code> executes in this stage, following
persistence and transaction commit all <code>ResultHandler</code> or

the steps that executed are invoked. This is done in the reverse order
of step execution, so the callback for the last step to run is the first
to be executed. The most common thing for a callback to do is to respond
to a rollback by doing whatever is necessary to reverse changes made in
<code>Stage.RUNTIME</code>. (No reversal of <code>Stage.MODEL</code> changes is needed,
because if an operation rolls back the updated model produced by the
operation is simply never published and is discarded.)</p>

<h4 id="tips-about-adding-steps">Tips About Adding Steps</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here are some useful tips about how to add steps:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add a step to the head of the current stage&#8217;s queue if you want it to
execute next, prior to any other steps. Typically you would use this
technique if you are trying to decompose some complex work into pieces,
with reusable logic handling each piece. There would be an
<code>OperationStepHandler</code> for each part of the work, added to the head of
the queue in the correct sequence. This would be a pretty advanced use
case for an extension author but is quite common in the handlers
provided by the kernel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a step to the end of the queue if either you don&#8217;t care when it
executes or if you do care and want to be sure it executes after any
already registered steps.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A very common example of this is a <code>Stage.MODEL</code> handler adding a
step for its associated <code>Stage.RUNTIME</code> work. If there are multiple
model steps that will execute (e.g. at boot or as part of handling a
<code>composite</code>), each will want to add a runtime step, and likely the best
order for those runtime steps is the same as the order of the model
steps. So if each adds its runtime step at the end, the desired result
will be achieved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A more sophisticated but important scenario is when a step may or may
not be executing as part of a larger set of steps, i.e. it may be one
step in a <code>composite</code> or it may not. There is no way for the handler to
know. But it can assume that if it is part of a composite, the steps for
the other operations in the composite <strong>are already registered in the
queue</strong>. (The handler for the <code>composite</code> op guarantees this.) So, if it
wants to do some work (say validation of the relationship between
different attributes or resources) the input to which may be affected by
possible other already registered steps, instead of doing that work
itself, it should register a different step at the <strong>end</strong> of the queue
and have that step do the work. This will ensure that when the
validation step runs, the other steps in the <code>composite</code> will have had a
chance to do their work. <strong>Rule of thumb: always doing any extra
validation work in an added step.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="passing-data-to-an-added-step">Passing Data to an Added Step</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Often a handler author will want to share state between the handler for
a step it adds and the handler that added it. There are a number of ways
this can be done:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Very often the <code>OperationStepHandler</code> for the added class is an inner
class of the handler that adds it. So here sharing state is easily done
using final variables in the outer class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The handler for the added step can accept values passed to its
constructor which can serve as shared state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>OperationContext</code> includes an Attachment API which allows
arbitary data to be attached to the context and retrieved by any handler
that has access to the attachment key.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>OperationContext.addStep</code> methods include overloaded variants
where the caller can pass in an <code>operation</code> <code>ModelNode</code> that will in
turn be passed to the <code>execute</code> method of the handler for the added
step. So, state can be passed via this <code>ModelNode</code>. It&#8217;s important to
remember though that the <code>address</code> field of the <code>operation</code> will govern
what the <code>OperationContext</code> sees as the target of operation when that
added step&#8217;s handler executes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="controlling-output-from-an-added-step">Controlling Output from an Added Step</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When an <code>OperationStepHandler</code> wants to report an operation result, it
calls the <code>OperationContext.getResult()</code> method and manipulates the
returned <code>ModelNode</code>. Similarly for failure messages it can call
<code>OperationContext.getFailureDescription()</code>. The usual assumption when
such a call is made is that the result or failure description being
modified is the one at the root of the response to the end user. But
this is not necessarily the case.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When an <code>OperationStepHandler</code> adds a step it can use one of the
overloaded <code>OperationContext.addStep</code> variants that takes a <code>response</code>
<code>ModelNode</code> parameter. If it does, whatever <code>ModelNode</code> it passes in
will be what is updated as a result of <code>OperationContext.getResult()</code>
and <code>OperationContext.getFailureDescription()</code> calls by the step&#8217;s
handler. This node does not need to be one that is directly associated
with the response to the user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How then does the handler that adds a step in this manner make use of
whatever results the added step produces, since the added step will not
run until the adding step completes execution? There are a couple of
ways this can be done.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first is to add yet another step, and provide it a reference to the
<code>response</code> node used by the second step. It will execute after the
second step and can read its response and use it in formulating its own
response.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second way involves using a <code>ResultHandler</code>. The <code>ResultHandler</code> for
a step will execute <strong>after</strong> any step that it adds executes. And, it is
legal for a <code>ResultHandler</code> to manipulate the "result" value for an
operation, or its "failure-description" in case of failure. So, the
handler that adds a step can provide to its <code>ResultHandler</code> a reference
to the <code>response</code> node it passed to <code>addStep</code>, and the <code>ResultHandler</code>
can in turn and use its contents to manipulate its own response.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This kind of handling wouldn&#8217;t commonly be done by extension authors and
great care needs to be taken if it is done. It is often done in some of
the kernel handlers.</p>

<p>When an operation first expresses a desire to manipulate the <code>Resource</code>

is created and thereafter the <code>OperationContext</code> works with that copy.
The copy is published back to the <code>ModelController</code> in <code>Stage.DONE</code> if
the operation commits. Until that happens any changes to the tree or
capability registry made by the operation are invisible to other
threads. If the operation does not commit, the private copies are simply
discarded.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Typically extensions create resources via <code>OperationStepHandler</code> calls
to the <code>OperationContext.createResource</code> method. However it is allowed
for handlers to use their own <code>Resource</code> implementations by
instantiating the resource and invoking <code>OperationContext.addResource</code>.
The <code>AbstractModelResource</code> class can be used as a base class.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="runtime-only-and-synthetic-resources-and-the-placeholderresourceentry-class">Runtime-Only and Synthetic Resources and the PlaceholderResourceEntry Class</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A runtime-only resource is one whose state is not persisted to the xml
configuration file. Many runtime-only resources are also "synthetic"
meaning they are not added or removed as a result of user initiated
management operations. Rather these resources are "synthesized" in order
to allow users to use the management API to examine some aspect of the
internal state of the process. A good example of synthetic resources are
the resources in the <code>/core-service=platform-mbeans</code> branch of the
resource tree. There are resources there that represent various aspects
of the JVM (classloaders, memory pools, etc) but which resources are
present entirely depends on what the JVM is doing, not on any management
action. Another example are resources representing "core queues" in the
WildFly messaging and messaging-artemismq subsystems. Queues are created
as a result of activity in the message broker which may not involve
calls to the management API. But for each such queue a management
resource is available to allow management users to perform management
operations against the queue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is a requirement of execution of a management operation that the
<code>OperationContext</code> can navigate through the resource tree to a
<code>Resource</code> object located at the address specified. This requirement
holds true even for synthetic resources. How can this be handled, given
the fact these resources are not created in response to management
operations?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The trick involves using special implementations of <code>Resource</code>. Let&#8217;s
imagine a simple case where we have a parent resource which is fairly
normal (i.e. it holds persistent configuration and is added via a user&#8217;s
<code>add</code> operation) except for the fact that one of its child types
represents synthetic resources (e.g. message queues). How would this be
handled?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, the parent resource would require a custom implementation of the
<code>Resource</code> interface. The <code>OperationStepHandler</code> for the <code>add</code> operation
would instantiate it, providing it with access to whatever API is needed
for it to work out what items exist for which a synthetic resource
should be made available (e.g. an API provided by the message broker
that provides access to its queues). The <code>add</code> handler would use the
<code>OperationContext.addResource</code> method to tie this custom resource into
the overall resource tree.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The custom <code>Resource</code> implementation would use special implementations
of the various methods that relate to accessing children. For all calls
that relate to the synthetic child type (e.g. core-queue) the custom
implementation would use whatever API call is needed to provide the
correct data for that child type (e.g. ask the message broker for the
names of queues).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A nice strategy for creating such a custom resource is to use
delegation. Use <code>Resource.Factory.create}()</code> to create a standard
resource. Then pass it to the constructor of your custom resource type
for use as a delegate. The custom resource type&#8217;s logic is focused on
the synthetic children; all other work it passes on to the delegate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What about the synthetic resources themselves, i.e. the leaf nodes in
this part of the tree? These are created on the fly by the parent
resource in response to <code>getChild</code>, <code>requireChild</code>, <code>getChildren</code> and
<code>navigate</code> calls that target the synthetic resource type. These
created-on-the-fly resources can be very lightweight, since they store
no configuration model and have no children. The
<code>PlaceholderResourceEntry</code> class is perfect for this. It&#8217;s a very
lightweight <code>Resource</code> implementation with minimal logic that only
stores the final element of the resource&#8217;s address as state.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>See <code>LoggingResource</code> in the WildFly Core logging subsystem for an
example of this kind of thing. Searching for other uses of
<code>PlaceholderResourceEntry</code> will show other examples.</p>

<p>The WildFly Core <code>controller</code> module includes a number of

directly, and that in other cases can serve as the base class for your
own handler implementation. In all of these a general goal is to

<h3 id="add-handlers">Add Handlers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>AbstractAddStepHandler</code> is a base class for handlers for <code>add</code>
operations. There are a number of ways you can configure its behavior,
the most commonly used of which are to:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Configure its behavior in <code>Stage.MODEL</code> by passing to its constructor
<code>AttributeDefinition</code> and <code>RuntimeCapability</code> instances for the
attributes and capabilities provided by the resource. The handler will
automatically validate the operation parameters whose names match the
provided attributes and store their values in the model of the newly
added <code>Resource</code>. It will also record the presence of the given
capabilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Control whether a <code>Stage.RUNTIME</code> step for the operation needs to be
added, by overriding the
<code>protected boolean requiresRuntime(OperationContext context)</code> method.
Doing this is atypical; the standard behavior in the base class is
appropriate for most cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement the primary logic of the <code>Stage.RUNTIME</code> step by overriding
the
<code>protected void performRuntime(final OperationContext context, final ModelNode operation, final Resource resource)</code>
method. This is typically the bulk of the code in an
<code>AbstractAddStepHandler</code> subclass. This is where you read data from the
<code>Resource</code> model and use it to do things like configure and install MSC
services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Handle any unusual needs of any rollback of the <code>Stage.RUNTIME</code> step
by overriding
<code>protected void rollbackRuntime(OperationContext context, final ModelNode operation, final Resource resource)</code>.
Doing this is not typically needed, since if the rollback behavior
needed is simply to remove any MSC services installed in
<code>performRuntime</code>, the <code>OperationContext</code> will do this for you
automatically.</p>
