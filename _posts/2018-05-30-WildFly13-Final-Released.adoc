= WildFly 13 "Baker's Dozen" is released!

WildFly 13 Final is now available link:{base_url}/downloads[for download]! 

EE8 Capabilities & New Release Model
-----------------------------------
This is our second release following our link:http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/wildfly-dev/2017-December/006250.html[new quarterly delivery model]. A central theme of this plan, is to deliver EE8 functionality in fully completed incremental chunks, as opposed to waiting for everything to finish in a big bang relase. WildFly 13 largely accomplishes this goal, by achieving EE8 feature completeness. WildFly 14 will focus on achieving formal certification, and converting over to a sole EE8 execution model. Since Java EE8 is fully backwards compatible, EE7 deployments will still function ast they do today. 

An overview of all changes for the EE8 execution mode are as follows:

|=======================================================================

By default WildFly 13 launches in EE7 mode. In order to use these new capabilities you have to enable EE8 preview mode. This can be accomplished by passing the `ee8.preview.mode` property during startup:

[source, bash]
----
./standalone.sh -Dee8.preview.mode=true
----

Alternatively, this can be achieved by launching the server using the new `standalone-ee8.xml` configuration, which simply includes the property in the config.

[source, bash]
----
./standalone.sh -c standalone-ee8.xml
----

The CLI can also be used to modify the existing configuration to add this property. For example:

[source, bash]
----
embed-server --admin-only=true
/system-property=ee8.preview.mode:add(value=true)
stop-embedded-server
----

Other Notable Items
-------------------
* WildFly 13 is now internally built using project Galleon, a new provisioning model for WildFly we plan to roll out in coming releases
* Java 10 compatibilty has been improved
* A major upgrade to the WildFly administration console (HAL version 3)
* Infinispan has been updated to 9.2
* Hibernate ORM has been updated to 5.3 when running in EE8 mode
