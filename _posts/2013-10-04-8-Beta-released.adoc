= WildFly 8 Beta is released!

I'm happy to announce the release of link:{base_url}/downloads[WildFly 8.0.0.Beta1]. This is a significant milestone because all planned major features have been implemented. Let's run through the big ones.

== Java EE7

Java EE7 offers applications several productivity improving capabilities
including support for the modern web, batch processing, simplified
concurrent task processing, and improvements in dependency injection. At
this point all user facing EE7 APIs have been implemented! Aside from
achieving compliance certification, the only remaining work is to
implement a few updates in the security integration SPIs, JASPIC and
JACC.


High Performance Web Server (http://undertow.io/[Undertow.io])
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Undertow, the new cutting-edge web server in WildFly 8 is designed for
maximum throughput and scalability, including environments with over a
million connections. It supports non-blocking and blocking handlers,
traditional and asynchronous servlets, and JSR-356 web socket handlers.
It is highly customizable, with the ability for applications to
implement nearly anything from dynamic request routing to custom
protocols. It can also function as a very efficient, pure non-blocking
reverse proxy, allowing WildFly to delegate to other web servers with
minimal impact to running applications. Undertow has been fully
integrated for several releases now. This release finalizes the key
features of this integration with reverse proxy support.

Port Reduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An important goal of WildFly 8 was to greatly reduce the number of ports
used by multiplexing protocols over HTTP using HTTP Upgrade. This is a
big benefit to cloud providers (such as OpenShift) who run hundreds to
thousands of instances on a single server. Our default configuration now
only has _three_ ports, and *_will become two ports by final._* We
decided to preserve the original native management port for this Beta
release to give those using legacy clients time to update before the
final release. *_The native management port, 9999, is deprecated and
will be removed by final._*

Management Role Based Access Control (RBAC) & Auditing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

WildFly can now support organizations with separated management
responsibilities and restrictions. Roles represent different sets of
permissions such as runtime operation execution, configuration areas
that can read or written, and the ability to audit changes and manage
users. In addition a new restricted audit log can be enabled including
the ability to offload to a secure syslog server.

Patching
~~~~~~~~

The infrastructure to support the application of patches to an existing
install has been implemented. This capability allows for a remote client
to install and rollback new static modules and binary files using the
WildFly management protocol.
