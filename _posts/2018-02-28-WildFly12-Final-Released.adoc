EE8 Capabilities & New Release Model
------------------------------------
This is our first release following our link:http://lists.jboss.org/pipermail/wildfly-dev/2017-December/006250.html[new quarterly delivery model]. As part of this plan, we are delivering EE8 functionality in fully completed incremental chunks, as opposed to waiting for everything to finish in a big bang reelase. WildFly 12 makes significant progress on this front, adding support for the majority of the new standards:

|=======================================================================

By default WildFly 12 launches in EE7 mode. In order to use these new capabilities you have to enable EE8 preview mode. This can be accomplished by passing the `ee8.preview.mode` property during startup:

[source, bash]
----
./standalone.sh -Dee8.preview.mode=true
----

Alternatively, this can be achieved by launching the server using the new `standalone-ee8.xml` configuration, which simply includes the property in the config.

[source, bash]
----
./standalone.sh -c standalone-ee8.xml
----

The CLI can also be used to modify the existing configuration to add this property. For example:

[source, bash]
----
embed-server --admin-only=true
/system-property=ee8.preview.mode:add(value=true)
stop-embedded-server
----

Other Notable Items
-------------------
* WildFly 12 includes a new thread pooling strategy that reduces the number of threads active at any given time, which helps conserve system resources. 
* MicroProfile REST Client 1.0 is now supported
* Java 9 compatibilty has been improved
* CLI scripts can now take advantage of loops with variables
* WildFly Documentation is now in asciidoc, and part of the source tree
