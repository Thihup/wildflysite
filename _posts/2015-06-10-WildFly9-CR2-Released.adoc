= WildFly 9 CR2 is released!

I'm happy to announce the link:{base_url}/downloads/[WildFly 9.0.0.CR2] release! This release addresses a number issues discovered during the CR1 cycle, and also includes a major UX 
update to the console.

For those new to WildFly 9, it builds off of WildFly 8's Java EE7 support, and adds many new capabilities, including intelligent load balancing, HTTP/2 support, a new offline CLI mode, graceful single node shutdown, and a new Servlet-only distribution. 

Provided no major issues are discovered, we hope to release Final within the next couple of weeks.

Enjoy!
