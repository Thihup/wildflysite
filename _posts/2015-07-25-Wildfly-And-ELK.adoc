= Centralized Logging for WildFly with the ELK Stack

The ELK stack;  https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[elasticsearch], https://www.elastic.co/products/logstash[logstash] and https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana[kibana] can be used for centralize logging. It's not the intention of this post to be a tutorial on how to configure logstash. We will go through a basic logstash configuration then configure WildFly to send log messages to logstash.

## Download and Configure logstash

First we need to https://download.elastic.co/logstash/logstash/logstash-1.5.3.zip[download logstash]. Once the download is complete simply extract logstash from the archive.

Next we will need to create a configuraton file. In the logstash directory create a file called `logstash-wildfly.conf` and add the following content to the configuration file.

[source,yaml]
----
input {
  tcp {
    port => 8000
  }
}

filter {
  json {
    source => "message"
  }
}

output {

  elasticsearch {
    # Use the embedded elsasticsearch for convienence
    embedded => true
    protocol => "http"
  }
}
----

Start logstash with the configuration file we just created `./bin/logstash agent -f logstash-wildfly.conf`. In the example configuration above logstash should be listening on port 8000. Make note of the port you use as we'll need it later when configuring WildFly.


## Configure WildFly

If you don't have a local install of WildFly you'll want to http://wildfly.org/downloads/[download] a recent version. In my example I'll be use http://download.jboss.org/wildfly/9.0.1.Final/wildfly-9.0.1.Final.zip[WildFly 9.0.1.Final]. However any other version should work the same.

We also need to download the https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/service/local/repositories/releases/content/org/jboss/logmanager/jboss-logmanager-ext/1.0.0.Alpha3/jboss-logmanager-ext-1.0.0.Alpha3.jar[jboss-logmanager-ext] library so that we can install it as a module. This library includes the formatter and handler we'll use for logging.

Start up WildFly in admin-only mode so we can configure logging, `$JBOSS_HOME/bin/standalone.sh --admin-only`. Once the server is running start a CLI console, `$JBOSS_HOME/bin/jboss-cli.sh -c`, to install the module and configure logging. The following commands can be entered manually or placed in a CLI script.


[source]
----
batch
# Add the module, replace the directory on the resources attribute to the path where you downloaded the jboss-logmanager-ext library
module add --name=org.jboss.logmanager.ext --dependencies=org.jboss.logmanager,javax.json.api,javax.xml.stream.api --resources=~/tmp/jboss-logmanager-ext-1.0.0.Alpha3.jar

# Add the logstash formatter
/subsystem=logging/custom-formatter=logstash:add(class=org.jboss.logmanager.ext.formatters.LogstashFormatter,module=org.jboss.logmanager.ext)

# Add a socket-handler using the logstash formatter. Replace the hostname and port to the values needed for your logstash install
/subsystem=logging/custom-handler=logstash-handler:add(class=org.jboss.logmanager.ext.handlers.SocketHandler,module=org.jboss.logmanager.ext,named-formatter=logstash,properties={hostname=localhost, port=8000})

# Add the new handler to the root-logger
/subsystem=logging/root-logger=ROOT:add-handler(name=logstash-handler)

# Reload the server which will boot the server into normal mode as well as write messages to logstash
:reload
run-batch
----

With these changes WildFly should be writing to logstash. You can view the log messages from logstash with https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana[kibana]. With the defaults we used you should just be able to start kibana with `bin/kibana` and the default configuration. My dashboard looks like the following.

## Conclusion

If you're already using the ELK stack for centralized logging adding WildFly to the aggregation is rather simple. If you're just looking for a way to view and filter log messages using the ELK stack with WildFly could be a good fit as well.

One thing to note is if you're seeing performance issues or you're writing to a remote logstash server you may want to use an async-handler.
