= Using exploded deployments and CLI attachments

In WildFly there used to be two worlds : one for developers with exploded deployments using a scanner and one for production where artifacts (wars/ears/jars) were deployed. +
Now those two worlds have collided and you can have exploded deployments without a scanner. +
And since this is using the management API you get remote access to the content for "free" and of course it works in domain mode. +
While this new feature is really usefull for tools developers (JBoss Developer Studio will use this in a tech preview, and NetBeans should use it also), YOU can also take advantage of it.

== Creating exploded deployments ==

There are two ways to create an exploded deployment:

 - Create an empty deployment and add content to it.
 - Deploy an artifact and explode it.
 
=== Creating an exploded deployment from scratch ===
 
Let's create a from_scratch.war deployment:
[source,ruby]
--
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /deployment=from_scratch.war:add(content=[{empty=true}])
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /deployment=from_scratch.war:add-content(content=[
          {input-stream-index=/home/ehsavoie/NetBeansProjects/SimpleWebapp/target/SimpleWebapp/index.html,target-path=index.html},
          {input-stream-index=/home/ehsavoie/NetBeansProjects/SimpleWebapp/target/SimpleWebapp/WEB-INF/web.xml, target-path=WEB-INF/web.xml},
          {input-stream-index=/home/ehsavoie/NetBeansProjects/SimpleWebapp/target/SimpleWebapp/WEB-INF/classes/org/wildfly/sample/simplewebapp/SimpleServlet.class, target-path=WEB-INF/classes/org/wildfly/sample/simplewebapp/SimpleServlet.class}])
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /deployment=from_scratch.war:deploy
--
Here we have created an empty deployment called from_scratch.war to which we have added 3 files:
    - a simple HTML page index.html.
    - A class file for a servlet.
    - A web.xml descriptor.

Then we have enabled the deployment and thus could access the index.html and the servlet. +
If you take a look at the $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/content/dc/9567f71b186466b21fff825d60f5fbc84ae6b1/content/ you will see the exploded war content. +
[IMPORTANT]
====
Since this content is managed, don't touch it directly by copying file to it manually, always use the Management API (through the jboss-cli or the web console).
====
[NOTE]
====
Note that the add-content can be used to replace files in a deployment but if the deployment is running this might not show until you redeploy it. +
You can also delete files in a deployment using remove-content but if the deployment is running this might not show until you redeploy it.
====

=== Exploding a deployment ===

Let's install and explode a to_be_exploded.war deployment:
[source,ruby]
--
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /deployment=to_be_exploded.war:add(content=[{input-stream-index=/home/ehsavoie/NetBeansProjects/SimpleWebapp/target/SimpleWebapp.war}],enabled=false)
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /deployment=to_be_exploded.war:explode
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /deployment=to_be_exploded.war:deploy
--

This can be achieved via the web console using the explode operation in the menu:
image::exploded_deployments/explode.png[explode]

If you take a look at the $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/content//cf/9918bad9d875ffb20da8747b5dcd15bdab16e0/content/ you will see the exploded war content (it differs from the first example hash has the war file contains META-INF files).
[IMPORTANT]
====
Since this content is managed, don't touch it directly by copying file to it manually, always use the Management API (through the jboss-cli or the web console).
====
[NOTE]
====
Note also that you can only explode an unexploded deployment or an archive file if the deployment is not running (aka is disabled).
====

== Reading content from a deployment ==
Now you can read content from a deployment, so you can directly see what's in your deployment. This operation can be use to browse the content of a deployment and read or download its files (even from inside an archive file).

=== Using the JBoss CLI ===
Using the browse-content operation you can have the list of files in the deployment :
[source,ruby]
--
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /deployment=to_be_exploded.war:browse-content  
{  
    "outcome" => "success",  
    "result" => [  
        {  
            "path" => "META-INF/",  
            "directory" => true  
        },  
        {  
            "path" => "META-INF/MANIFEST.MF",  
            "directory" => false,  
            "file-size" => 134L  
        },  
        {  
            "path" => "WEB-INF/",  
            "directory" => true  
        },  
        {  
            "path" => "WEB-INF/classes/",  
            "directory" => true  
        },  
        {  
            "path" => "WEB-INF/classes/org/",  
            "directory" => true  
        },  
        {  
            "path" => "WEB-INF/classes/org/wildfly/",  
            "directory" => true  
        },  
        {  
            "path" => "WEB-INF/classes/org/wildfly/sample/",  
            "directory" => true  
        },  
        {  
            "path" => "WEB-INF/classes/org/wildfly/sample/simplewebapp/",  
            "directory" => true  
        },  
        {  
            "path" => "WEB-INF/web.xml",  
            "directory" => false,  
            "file-size" => 916L  
        },  
        {  
            "path" => "WEB-INF/classes/org/wildfly/sample/simplewebapp/SimpleServlet.class",  
            "directory" => false,  
            "file-size" => 2302L  
        },  
        {  
            "path" => "index.html",  
            "directory" => false,  
            "file-size" => 234L  
        },  
        {  
            "path" => "META-INF/maven/",  
            "directory" => true  
        },  
        {  
            "path" => "META-INF/maven/org.wildfly.sample/",  
            "directory" => true  
        },  
        {  
            "path" => "META-INF/maven/org.wildfly.sample/SimpleWebapp/",  
            "directory" => true  
        },  
        {  
            "path" => "META-INF/maven/org.wildfly.sample/SimpleWebapp/pom.xml",  
            "directory" => false,  
            "file-size" => 2992L  
        },  
        {  
            "path" => "META-INF/maven/org.wildfly.sample/SimpleWebapp/pom.properties",  
            "directory" => false,  
            "file-size" => 125L  
        }  
    ]  
}
--
You can reduce the output by filtering using the __path__, _depth_ and _archive_ parameters.
For exemple 
[source,ruby]
--
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /deployment=to_be_exploded.war:browse-content(path=WEB-INF/, depth=1)
{
    "outcome" => "success",
    "result" => [
        {
            "path" => "web.xml",
            "directory" => false,
            "file-size" => 916L
        },
        {
            "path" => "classes/",
            "directory" => true
        }
    ]
}
--
So now we can display the content of the web.xml. Using the read-content operation is not sufficient enough as it will return an attachment:
[source,ruby]
--
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] /deployment=to_be_exploded.war:read-content(path=WEB-INF/web.xml)  
{  
    "outcome" => "success",  
    "result" => {"uuid" => "c778c51e-a507-4a71-a21f-d6af8b230db4"},  
    "response-headers" => {"attached-streams" => [{  
        "uuid" => "c778c51e-a507-4a71-a21f-d6af8b230db4",  
        "mime-type" => "application/xml"  
    }]}  
}  
--

So we need to combine this operation with the attachment operation like this :
[source,ruby]
--
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] attachment display --operation=/deployment=to_be_exploded.war:read-content(path=WEB-INF/web.xml)  
ATTACHMENT 582a10e0-5159-4d2b-8d07-8d39af0df8c3:  
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    
<web-app xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee"  
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"  
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_3_1.xsd"  
    version="3.1">  
    <session-config>  
        <session-timeout>  
            30  
        </session-timeout>  
    </session-config>  
    <servlet id="SimpleServlet">  
        <servlet-name>SimpleServlet</servlet-name>  
        <display-name>SimpleServlet</display-name>  
        <servlet-class>org.wildfly.sample.simplewebapp.SimpleServlet</servlet-class>  
        <init-param>  
            <param-name>message</param-name>  
            <param-value>Hello World</param-value>  
        </init-param>  
    </servlet>  
    <servlet-mapping>  
        <servlet-name>SimpleServlet</servlet-name>  
        <url-pattern>/SimpleServlet</url-pattern>  
    </servlet-mapping>  
</web-app>  
--

And to save this content locally we can use:
[source,ruby]
--
[standalone@localhost:9990 /] attachment save --operation=/deployment=to_be_exploded.war:read-content(path=WEB-INF/web.xml) --file=/home/ehsavoie/tmp/web.xml  
File saved to /home/ehsavoie/tmp/web.xml 
--

=== Using the web console ===
Navigate to 'Deployments' and select the deployment you want to browse. Then open the context menu and choose Browse Content:

image::exploded_deployments/browse_content_op.png[]

This opens a new page with the contents of the deployment. For each file, there's a link with the full path and size of the file. Click on the link to download the file:

image::exploded_deployments/content.png[]

=== Using HAL.NEXT ===
The next major version of the web console (HAL.next) is currently under active development and is available as technical preview https://github.com/hal/hal.next.
Follow the instruction in https://github.com/hal/hal.next#running  to get started.
Besides general improvements like better navigation and a revisited look and feel, HAL.next comes with many improvements for dealing with deployments: 

- Add Deployments using drag & drop. 
- New content browser using a tree view and an editor with syntax highlighting. 
- Download complete deployments or single files of a deployment. 

Select deployments and just click on View to display its content:

image::exploded_deployments/explode_next.png[]

This opens a new page which allows for a really nice way to browse and read content from a deployment:

image::exploded_deployments/content_next.png[]
